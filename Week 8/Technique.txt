1. Assume a distribution with unknown parameters theta1 theta2
2. Get the training data (Do experiments)
3. Write the likelihood equation (probability)
 	P(D|theta1, theta2)
4. Take the logarithm of likelihood, differentiate and equate to 0 and solve for theta

Maximum

Central Limit Theorem

if n -> infinity
the mean of samples from any distribution tends to gaussian/normal distribution

Estimator is unbiased if E(X) = x
otherwise it is biased
